# Amazon Sales Report #

PS: The project is still under development!
## A brief introduction:
This is an interactive Amazon Sale Report I created on PowerBI. I took the Dataset from Kaggle. There are 2 files. One is .CSV which consists of approximately 18,00,000 Rows (40 MB) and the other is .XLSX file which is of approximately 16 MB. The .csv file consists of:
* Order ID
* Fulfillment
* SKU
* Catagory
* Size
* ASIN No.
* Ship Status
* Amount
* More column details in the file

The .xlsx file consists of:
* Has an Amazon Prime Y/N
* ASIN No.
* Bestseller
* Delivery Type
* Discount %
* Product Details
* More info (Download the Dataset)

I will Provide both the filtered/cleaned and uncleaned Datasets in the Repository. The cleaning process consisted of removing the unnecessary columns that we didn't need, then I changed the column types. Incorrect column types may lead to errors in the Dataset while performing. I also wrote some DAX Queries to create a new column and also some column operations that I will provide the file in the Repository. 

The left side of the Report consists of the Products section
